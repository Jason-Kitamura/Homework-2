For the responsive portfolio assignment, I have made a website made up of 3 pages:

- About Me
- Portfolio
- Contact

All of the pages (and images) included are made to be responsive for any size screen. Specifically, on an xs-screen, the containers take up most of the width of the page (to let some background peek through), and larger screens have larger (and still responsive) margins.

To naviate through the pages, there is a navigation bar that includes the corresponding links. On a smaller screen, these links fold into a dropdown menu.

To spice up the website I have added extra elements such as stunning background images, opac and bordered containers/navbar/header, and different positionings for containers.
